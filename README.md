# TurbineEnergyYield_CO_and_NOx-Emission

## [Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+Turbine+CO+and+NOx+Emission+Data+Set)
The dataset contains 36733 instances of 11 sensor measures aggregated over one hour (by means of average or sum) from a gas turbine located in Turkey's north western region for the purpose of studying flue gas emissions, namely CO and NOx (NO + NO2). The data comes from the same power plant as the dataset used for predicting hourly net energy yield. By contrast, this data is collected in another data range (01.01.2011 - 31.12.2015), includes gas turbine parameters (such as Turbine Inlet Temperature and Compressor Discharge pressure) in addition to the ambient variables.
